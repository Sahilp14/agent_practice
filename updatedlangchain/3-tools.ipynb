       "AIMessage(content='<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking \"who is Rohit Sharma?\" So I need to provide a comprehensive answer about him. Let me start by recalling what I know about him. He\\'s a cricketer from India, right? Plays for the Indian national team.\\n\\nFirst, his full name is Rohit Sharma. I should mention his birthdate and place. I think he was born in 1987 in Mumbai. Correct? Let me verify that. Yes, he was born on April 30, 1987, in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.\\n\\nHe\\'s a batsman, primarily a right-handed opener. But he also bowls off-spin occasionally. He\\'s known for his aggressive batting style and being a finisher in limited-overs cricket. I should note his nickname, maybe \"Hitman\" or \"Chiku,\" which is a nickname derived from his name.\\n\\nHe\\'s played in all formats of the game: Test, ODI, T20I. He\\'s the highest run-scorer in T20Is and ODIs for India. Wait, is he the highest overall? Or just for India? Let me check. As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, he\\'s the highest run-scorer for India in both ODIs and T20Is. Overall in T20Is, Chris Gayle is first, but for India, Rohit is the top. In ODIs, he\\'s also the top for India. In Tests, he\\'s a good player too, but maybe not as dominant as in limited-overs.\\n\\nHe\\'s captained the Indian team in Test, ODI, and T20I formats. He took over as Test captain in 2017, succeeding Virat Kohli. In ODIs, he was captain before Virat became the captain again. He\\'s known for his calm leadership and strategic mind.\\n\\nHe plays for Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and has been a key player there. Mumbai Indians have won the IPL multiple times, which he\\'s been part of. He\\'s also played for franchises abroad like Rising Pune Supergiants and Sunrisers Hyderabad, but his main team is Mumbai Indians.\\n\\nHe has a few records. For example, he scored a double hundred in ODI cricket (264* against Sri Lanka in 2019). Also, he\\'s one of the few players to achieve the \"Double Century Club\" in ODIs. In T20Is, he\\'s the leading run-scorer with over 4000 runs as of my last update.\\n\\nHe\\'s been a part of the Indian team in several World Cups and World T20s. Notably, he captained India in the 2019 Cricket World Cup, where they reached the semi-finals. He\\'s also part of the Indian team that won the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy.\\n\\nHe\\'s known for his cool demeanor, even under pressure. He\\'s got a calmness that makes him a great finisher. Also, his ability to play innovative shots, like the helicopter shot, which he popularized. That\\'s a shot where he rotates his body like a helicopter while hitting a six.\\n\\nHe\\'s been awarded the Padma Shri, India\\'s fourth-highest civilian award, in 2017 for his contributions to sports.\\n\\nI should also mention his role as a mentor in the IPL and his contributions to developing younger players. He\\'s been involved in community initiatives as well, like the \"Rohit Sharma Foundation\" focusing on education and health for underprivileged children.\\n\\nWait, did he retire from international cricket? No, he\\'s still active as of 2023. Maybe in 2024, but according to my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, he\\'s still playing. But I should check if there\\'s any recent news about his retirement. Since the user is asking now, maybe they want the latest info. However, I can\\'t use data beyond October 2023. So I should stick to that.\\n\\nAlso, mention his personal life briefly. He\\'s married to Ritika Sajdeh, and they have a son. They got married in 2018. He\\'s also known for his philanthropy and being a role model for young cricketers.\\n\\nI need to structure this information in a coherent way. Start with his full name, birth details, profession. Then his role in cricket, batting style, captaincy. Mention his achievements, records, IPL involvement, awards, and personal life. Make sure to highlight his significance in the cricketing world.\\n\\nCheck for any inaccuracies: double-check dates, records, and roles. For example, was he the captain in all three formats? Yes, he captained India in Tests, ODIs, and T20Is. Also, his batting average in Tests is lower compared to limited-overs, but he\\'s effective in shorter formats.\\n\\nInclude some key milestones: like the fastest to 10,000 Test runs, which he achieved in 2021. Also, his performance in recent tours, like the 2023 World Cup.\\n\\nAlright, compiling all this into a structured, clear response without markdown. Make sure to be concise but informative, covering all major aspects of his career and personal life.\\n</think>\\n\\nRohit Sharma is an Indian international cricketer and a former captain of the Indian national team, widely regarded as one of the most versatile and innovative batsmen in modern cricket.
