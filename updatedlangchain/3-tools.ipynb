       "AIMessage(content='<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking \"who is rohit sharma?\" Let me start by recalling what I know about him. He\\'s a cricketer from India, right? I think he plays for the Indian cricket team. His full name is Rohit Sharma, and he\\'s known for being a batsman. \\n\\nFirst, I should mention his birth details. I believe he was born in 1987 in Mumbai. That makes him around 36 years old now. He\\'s a key player in the Indian team, maybe even their captain in some formats. Wait, he was the captain of the Indian ODI and T20I teams, but I think he stepped down recently. Virat Kohli took over as ODI captain, so maybe that\\'s a point to include.\\n\\nHe\\'s known for his aggressive batting style. I remember he\\'s one of the highest run-scorers in international cricket. Let me check the stats. He holds the record for the most runs in ODIs and Test cricket. Oh, and he\\'s a left-handed batsman. That\\'s a unique trait because he\\'s one of the few left-handers in the team. \\n\\nHe\\'s also played for various IPL teams. He was the captain of Mumbai Indians, right? They won the IPL multiple times under his leadership. That\\'s four titles, I think. That shows his leadership and batting skills. \\n\\nHe has a nickname, \"Hitman,\" because he can hit the ball really hard. I should mention that. Also, he\\'s a good fielder, though that\\'s maybe less known. \\n\\nHis achievements include being the first player to score 6000 runs in T20Is. He\\'s a key figure in the Indian team\\'s batting lineup. I should also note that he\\'s a three-time World Cup winner. Wait, the 2011 World Cup with India, then the ICC T20 World Cup in 2016 and 2024 as captain. Wait, the 2024 T20 World Cup? I need to verify that. India won the 2024 T20 World Cup, and he was the captain. So that\\'s three titles. \\n\\nAlso, his personal milestones: he\\'s the first player to score 100 international centuries. Let me confirm that. Yes, he achieved that in 2023. \\n\\nI should structure this into sections: early life, career, captaincy, achievements, and maybe personal life. Avoid any errors, like mixing up dates or titles. Make sure to highlight his role as a batsman, leadership, and key records. \\n\\nWait, I think he was the highest run-scorer in ODIs before Virat Kohli took over? No, actually, Kohli overtook him in 2023. So now Kohli is the leading run-scorer in ODIs. But Rohit still has the highest individual score in ODIs, maybe? No, that\\'s Sachin Tendulkar with 264. Hmm. \\n\\nAlso, his Test career: he\\'s the highest run-scorer in Tests for India. He\\'s known for Test centuries, but maybe not as many as Kohli. \\n\\nI should mention his role in the Mumbai Indians, leading them to four IPL titles. That\\'s a significant achievement in domestic cricket. \\n\\nAnother point is his aggressive style and ability to play different formats. He\\'s a T20 specialist as well, with a high strike rate. \\n\\nI need to make sure all the information is up-to-date. For example, his captaincy status. He\\'s not the ODI captain anymore, but maybe still in T20Is? Let me check. As of 2023, he stepped down as ODI captain in 2022, and Virat took over. He\\'s still the T20I captain, but in 2024, India won the T20 World Cup under his captaincy. \\n\\nAlso, his batting average and strike rate in different formats. In ODIs, he has a very high strike rate. In Tests, maybe not as high, but he\\'s consistent. \\n\\nI should avoid any errors in the details. Let me verify the number of IPL titles with Mumbai Indians. They won in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020. Wait, that\\'s five titles. Did he captain them in all? Yes, he was captain from 2013 to 2020, except for the 2013 season where he was co-captain with Gautam Gambhir. Wait, no, he became sole captain in 2014. So the titles under him would be 2013 (co-captain), 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020. So five titles. I need to clarify that. \\n\\nAlso, his personal life: married to Ritika Shroff, a former model. They have a daughter. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the answer should cover his background, career highlights, captaincy, records, and maybe his current status. Keep it concise but informative.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rohit Sharma** is a prominent Indian cricketer and former captain of the Indian national team, widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.
